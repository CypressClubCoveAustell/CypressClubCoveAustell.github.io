Hello, neighbors!

We're excited to announce that the annual Cypress Club/Cove HOA meeting will be happening on August 20th, at 7 pm in our Clubhouse. It's a pivotal event where we'll be electing our new Board of Directors, forming committees, and exploring business opportunities to enhance our community.

As residents of our vibrant community, your voice is essential in shaping our future. The HOA President will soon send out nomination forms for the Board member positions. Remember, this is your chance to get involved and help guide our collective decisions.

Whether you're keen on voting, asking questions, or simply sharing your ideas for improvement, we wholeheartedly encourage your active participation in the meeting.

Getting involved is easy. Nomination forms are accessible in the clubhouse's information box or can be printed from this [link](https://cypresscc.org/PDFs/2023-Annual_Meeting_Proxy_Vote_Form.pdf). Make sure to drop your completed forms into the red box at the clubhouse by August 13th.

Please note, to have your votes counted, it's essential that your HOA dues are up-to-date.

We can't wait to see you at the meeting!

Let's continue to build a better community, together.
